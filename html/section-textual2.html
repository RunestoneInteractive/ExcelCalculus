<p id="p-4">We will start this chapter with a review of linear functions. In business there are quite a few examples of linear equations. Examples include supply and demand functions. There are some standard concepts related to lines that we will review, including the slope. </p>
<p id="p-5">
Following the conventions of microeconomics, we will often use the variables p and q, for price and quantity, rather than x and y.  We will also follow the conventions of economics in treating quantity as the independent variable.  (The q-axis will be the horizontal axis.  A fast web search for supply demand equilibrium will convince you this standard usage.)</p>
<p id="p-6">Equations of a line</p>
<p id="p-7">From prior courses such as college algebra you will remember that lines can be written in several different forms. If we are given the slope and the \(y\)-intercept, the slope-intercept will be the equation of choice. If we are given a point and a slope, it might be faster if we use the point-slope form for a line. </p>
<p id="p-8">\(y=m x+b\)  the slope-intercept form of a line</p>
<p id="p-9">\(y-y_0=m(x-x_0)\) the point-slope form of a line</p>
<p id="p-10">In a business setting we are likely to use \(q\) instead of \(x\) and \(p\) instead of \(y\). </p>
<p id="p-11">With this notation these standard equations of a line become:</p>
<p id="p-12">\(p=m q+b\)  the slope-intercept form of a line</p>
<p id="p-13">\(p-p_0=m(q-q_0)\) the point-slope form of a line</p>
<p id="p-14">Example 1: Supply and demand equations are often modeled by linear equations. The supply function is a line with a positive slope, and the demand function is a line with a negative slope.</p>
<p id="p-15">The vertical axis shows the price, the horizontal axis shows quantity. Both supply (S) and demand (D) are linear functions. In this diagram ‘B’ denotes a surplus of supply, and ‘A’ denotes a surplus of demand.</p>
<p id="p-16">


Recall, that the slope of a line through the points P_0=(q_0,p_0) and P_1=(q_1,p_1) is given by
m=rise/run=(p_1-p_0)/(q_1-q_0 )

 

There are two other forms of a line that are sometimes used. The general form of a line is a standard notation used in mathematics. The 2-point form of a line is very handy in those situations where we are not given a slope, but we are given information about two points that lie on the line.

a x+b y+c=0  The general form of a line
y-y_0=(y_1-y_0)/(x_1-x_0 )(x-x_0) The 2-point form of a line

As above, in the setting of this course we may be using p (price) and q (quantity) as our variables. This would result in equations that look as follows:

a p+b q+c=0  The general form of a line
p-p_0=(p_1-p_0)/(q_1-q_0 )(q-q_0) The 2-point form of a line
</p>
<p id="p-17">
Example 2: We find that we can sell 150 widgets a day if we sell them at $10.  If we raise the price to $15, we can only sell 110 widgets a day.  Assume that there is a linear relationship between price and quantity sold.  Find the equation of the line in all four forms.

Solution 2:  Writing this using our variables p (price) and q (quantity of widgets) we see that when p = 10, q = 150 and when p = 15, q = 110.  Points are (usually) given as (q,p), so this means we have two point (150,10) and (110,15) on the line. 
We always need to find the slope of the line, and in this case 
m=  (15-10)/(110-150)=  5/(-40)= -1/8

We are given two points, so the 2-point form of the line should be the easiest formula to find: 
p-p_0=(p_1-p_0)/(q_1-q_0 )(q-q_0)

We just found the slope and we just need to pick a point (p_0,q_0) to finish the problem. (Recall that p and q are the variables, so we want to leave those as they are.) In this case lets pick (p_0,q_0)= (150,10). Then we get this simplified version, which is also the point-slope form of this line.
p-10=(-1)/8(q-150)

From here we can very easily find the slope intercept form by some straight-forward algebra:
p-10=(-1)/8(q-150) implies that 
p=(-1)/8 (q-150)+100=  (-1)/8 q+  150/8+10=  (-1)/8 q+230/8
</p>
<p id="p-18">
And finally the general form will be another exercise in algebra. We clear the fractions and put everything on one side.

8p+q-230=0.</p>
<p id="p-19">Example 3:  Suppose that a linear cost-quantity relationship exists in producing widgets.  There is a fixed cost of $400.  There is also a per-unit cost of $11.  
	Find the equation of the line.  
	Find the cost of making 200 widgets.</p>
<p id="p-20">Solution 3:  a) We have one point of the form (quantity, cost) at (0, 400) from the fixed cost.  This point happens to be an intercept.  The slope of the line is m=11/1=11.  We will let C stand for Cost and q stand for quantity. The general formula for a line with these variables will have the form
C=m q+b
In this example m = 11 and b = 400, hence the equation of the line is
C=11 q+400
b) Using the equation form part a) we see that the cost of producing 200 widgets is
C=11 (200)+400=$2,600

</p>
<p id="p-21">
Example 4:  Sarah is paid $500 for working up to 40 hours per week.  For work beyond 40 hours per week she is paid $18/hour.  
	Find the equation for the line.  
	How much is she paid if she works 56 hours in a week?  
	What is she paid for working 30 hours in a week?

Solution 4:	a) For this example we will use “designer variables”. The output will be Pay, and the input variable – the number of hours worked – will be hrs. We are told that Pay = 500 when hrs = 40. The slope of the line work beyond 40 hours is m=18.  Another way to think of this is to say that there is a fixed Pay of $500 and a variable Pay for any hours in excess of 40: i.e. (hrs - 40). Thus, the equation of the line, according to the point-slope form is 
Pay=variable pay+Fixed pay.

Pay=m(hrs-40)+500=18*(hrs-40)+500.

b) The pay for working 56 hours is 18(56-40)+500=$788.
c) The pay for working 30 hours is $500.  This is a trick question part of the problem.  From the text of the problem, the linear model only works for overtime, with a flat rate applying to less than 40 hours per week.
Comment: The function should be written as a piecewise defined function. 
Pay={■(500                                         if hrs≤40@18*(hrs-40)+500      if hrs&gt;40)┤
It can be useful when writing reports to have variables that convey some meaning. We could have called Pay ‘y’, and hrs ‘x’, but using the much more easily interpreted variables named Pay and hrs helps when using the formulas.
