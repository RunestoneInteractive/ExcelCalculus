<p>The functions ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROUNDDOWN are all used for rounding.  They have a second argument that specifies the number off digits to which we are rounding.  It should be noted that Excel understands up and down as away form zero for negative numbers.  Thus it will round -1.5 up to -2. The CEILING and FLOOR functions also do rounding, but with some different features.  Instead of specifying the number of digits in the answer, these functions round to a multiple of the second argument.  As expected, CEILING rounds to the next higher multiple, and FLOOR rounds to the next lower multiple.</p>
