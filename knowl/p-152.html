<p>When modeling real world behavior, we often know some special features of the problem. For instance, we may know that our present value is $2,000 and that we would like the future value to be $10,000 after 10 years. The question would be what function would describe such a model? A method commonly used to solve such a problem is to plug in the values we are given and see if we can determine what the remaining quantities should be. We know that \(FV=PV*(1+r)^t\text{.}\) The extra information tells us PV = 2000, and when t = 10 we know that \(FV=2000*(1+r)^{10}=10,000\text{.}\) This is enough information to solve for r. Dividing both sides by 2000 shows that \((1+r)^{10}=5\text{.}\) To solve this equation we need rules of exponents. We obtain: \(1+r=5^{1‚ÅÑ10}\text{,}\) and hence \(r= 5^{1/10}-1= 0.1746\text{.}\) This means that to obtain such a growth we would need a rate of growth of about 17.46%. The function modeling that growth would be \(FV=2000*(1.1746)^t\text{.}\) In general we can set up equations and solve for the unknown quantities.</p>
