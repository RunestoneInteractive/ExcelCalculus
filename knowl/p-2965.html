<p>We have looked at three methods for finding a portion of a normally distributed population, which we describe as Excel with Riemann sums, Excel with statistics commands, and CAS.  It is worthwhile to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the methods.  The Riemann sums method takes the most work to set up.  It is also conceptually the most straightforward and the most flexible.  It is the easiest to adapt if we are doing some nonstandard distribution of a population.  It also shows intermediate values if we have a less sharp question and are trying to see what is going on and are still deciding on the business question we want to ask.  The Excel with statistics command approach requires us to learn special commands.  It is also less work.  It would probably be the favored method if we were doing a lot of these computations.  It should be noted that Excel has corresponding commands for the other standard probability distributions. The CAS method does not require special commands, but it takes us out of our Excel environment.  It does not let us leave a worksheet that is well documented and that can be easily modified by someone else asking similar questions.</p>
