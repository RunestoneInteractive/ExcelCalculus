<p>The middle method, using Solver is a hybrid of the other two methods.  We start by deciding on the mathematical model that should fit our situation.  As we saw, the method is straightforward to adapt to any kind of equation.  It is straightforward to explicitly build our error function.  This method also has the advantage of making the error attributed to each point visible.  We can see if another curve is almost as good as the solution we find.</p>
