<p>The last equation illustrates the use of marginal functions.  While producing and selling the 26th widget did increase total revenue, the marginal profit was negative, so I would have been better off if I had made fewer widgets. Notice that the marginal value of producing the 1st widget is not on the spreadsheet and needs to be dealt with as a special case.  Given our functions we have two reasonable ways to understand the value \(Cost(0)\text{.}\)  Either we can assume that there is no cost to not being in a business, so \(Cost(0)=0\text{,}\) and our cost function was only valid for positive numbers, or that the \(Cost(0)\) is understood an the fixed costs, which we have already undertaken, like a tax or license fee, so \(Cost(0)=40\) for this problem.  Both are reasonable interpretations.  We will need to look at the context of our problem to decide on the correct interpretation.</p>
