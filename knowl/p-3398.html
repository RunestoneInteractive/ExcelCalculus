<em class="terminology">Boundary value problems</em>: The accumulation problems asked you to find the area under a curve between two specific points.  For those problems, we are not interested in a formulation of a general area function.  A second set of applications starts with a derivative and is interested in finding the particular anti-derivative that meets certain initial conditions.  (We use the conditions to find the correct value of "+C" in the general anti-derivative.)  These problems are often solved once to find the general anti-derivative for a particular kind of problem, and the general solution is then used as a formula to find the constant C.</p>
