<p>In the last section we looked at using the partial derivatives to find the maximum or minimum of a function in several variables.  This is an extension of the optimization problems we did with functions of a single variable.  It is worthwhile to take another look at best fitting curves or trendlines, a process Excel has been doing throughout the course and see that it is a particular example of optimization.  This will let us to best fitting curves that use models other than the ones used by the trendline command.</p>
