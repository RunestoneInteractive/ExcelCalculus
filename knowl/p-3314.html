We want to look at an extended example where we realistically want to find a definite integral, but need to use numerical methods rather than solving for the antiderivative and using the fundamental theorem of calculus.
Most students are familiar with the concept of a course that is graded on a curve.  Formally that means that there is a preset distribution of grades available in the class, with a certain percentage of the students getting an A, a certain percentage getting a B, and so forth.  Most college students are also familiar with the ACT, SAT, or other standardized tests, where the grades typically follow a normal or bell curve.  The result we pull from more advanced mathematics is that many phenomena such as height, weight, and hat size, also follow a bell curve.  In a business setting, we are often concerned whether or not a portion of a market will be big enough to support a specialty store.  We also want to know how much of my production should be allocated to a range of sizes of a product.  This question often boils down to finding the area under a specified portion of the normal curve.</p>
