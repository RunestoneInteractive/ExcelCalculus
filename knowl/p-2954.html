<p>When we compute a target population, we sometimes want to include the tail of the distribution.  We might, for example be concerned with all women who are 5 feet tall or less.  This sets up an integral over an infinite interval, which we canâ€™t do as a Riemann sum.  The first workaround notes that the tails are very small.  If all humans who have ever lived are normally distributed, less than 1 is more than 7 standard deviations from the mean.  Taking the integral down to -7 will practically be the same as integrating down to \(-\infty\text{.}\)  The second workaround uses the symmetry of the normal distribution.</p>
