<p>In retail, there are several examples of items that follow a normal distribution. In a store selling shoes for women for instance, we would expect to see that some sizes are more prevalent than others. This would be a factor in determining what sizes to have in stock, and at what quantities. The typical scenario in which we will be using this curve model is one where we ask what range of sizes do we need to cover for the population in an area to be large enough to justify a specialty store.</p>
