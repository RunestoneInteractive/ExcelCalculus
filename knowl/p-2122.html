<p>The next task to consider is making a table of values for a function of several variables.  Since our screens have 2 dimensions, we first look at the case when we allow two values to change.  When we made a table for a single variable, we had to use both absolute and relative cell reference to distinguish between constant values used for all entries and variables that changed in each case.  With functions of two variables our table will have rows where one variable is held constant and columns where the other is held constant.  We note that quick filling a formula with the reference $A5 will keep the column, A constant but allow the row to change.  Similarly with the reference A$5 the column can change, but the row is constant.</p>
