<p><dfn class="terminology">Warning</dfn>: In example 2 we saw that relying on the graph could deceive us.  The flip side is an example where relying on Solver can deceive us. We mentioned earlier that Solver uses a variant of Newtonâ€™s method to find values.  In rough terms, it repeatedly finds the linear approximation and slides up or down that line to the desired answer.  If we start close to the answer, this is a very effective method of finding a numerical solution.  However it is easy to construct problems where this leads to a blind alley or to the wrong answer.  In particular, the method has great difficulty with problems where the function is not differentiable or where it has several bends.  Consider the following example.</p>
