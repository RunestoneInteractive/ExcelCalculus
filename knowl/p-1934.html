<p>As we have seen, \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is the instantaneous rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\text{.}\)  In chapter 4 we learned techniques for finding \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) when \(y\) is defined as a function of \(x\text{.}\)  In the last section we learned how to use implicit differentiation to find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) when we were given an equation in \(x\) and \(y\text{.}\)  In this section we want find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) when \(x\) and \(y\) are both described in terms of another variable.  As with the section on related rates, we will start with an example where we can solve the problem by eliminating the extra variable before differentiating, and then look at how to solve with related rates.</p>
