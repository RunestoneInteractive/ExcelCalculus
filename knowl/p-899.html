<p>There are a number of industries where it is common for people to pay significantly different prices for the same product from the same vender.  (Airline tickets, symphony seats, and doughnuts at different times of the day come to mind.)  The reason is generally not favoritism or an irrational vender, but an analysis that looks at the change in costs and profits for making an additional sale.  Flying a plane with 51 passengers does not cost much more than flying the same plane with 50 passengers.  The same is true when playing a symphony.  Selling an extra doughnut at half price, just before closing when you would have to throw the doughnut out adds to the profit.  In all of these cases, we are less concerned with total revenues and profits and more concerned with how things change with one more sale.</p>
