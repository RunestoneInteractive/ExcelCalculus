<p>The method of graphing points and using the trendline command has the advantage of being the simplest method when it works.  The biggest disadvantage of this method is that it only works with a small collection of mathematical models.  (We can use this method if our desired equation is linear, \(y=mx+b\text{,}\) logarithmic, \(y=a \log(x)+b\text{,}\) polynomial of degree no more than 6, power, \(y=ax^b\text{,}\) or exponential, \(y=ae^bx\text{.}\))  As we have seen in this section, it is not hard to find situations where some other model should be used.  This method also has the disadvantage of simply giving an answer without showing intermediate steps that might provide other useful information.</p>
