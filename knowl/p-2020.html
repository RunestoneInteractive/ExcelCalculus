<p>The law of demand states we increase demand by lowering price and lower demand by raising price.  The naive rate of change in that case would be the change in quantity with respect to price.  However that rate of change is not particularly useful.  If I am told that I can sell 100 more units if I lower the price by $1 a unit, I donâ€™t know if I should lower the price.  I would definitely want to lower the price if I sell cars for an average price of $20,000 and typically sell 200 cars a year.  I would not want to lower the price if I sell gasoline at $4.00 a gallon and sell 5,000,000 gallons a year.</p>
