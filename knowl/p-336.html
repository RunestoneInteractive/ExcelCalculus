<p>Excel has a lot of ways to add formatting to a graph or chart, many more than we want to be concerned with at this point.  We simply point out a few and leave it to the reader to explore how this should be used for a good visual presentation.  If you click once on the chart to select it, the Chart tab in the home ribbon, adds sub-tabs for layout and format.  With Chart Title, you can add a title to the chart, then edit it.  The Axes icon allows you to add titles for the axes.  If you select a data point form \(g(x)\text{,}\) you can then use the Data Labels icon to add values next to the points.  The chart with these annotations is given below.  The rule of thumb to follow is to add enough annotations for a reader to be able to easily understand what is happening in the chart.</p>
