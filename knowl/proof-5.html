<p id="p-480">Suppose there exists an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on the set \(X\).  For any \(x \in X\), the reflexive property shows that \(x \in [x]\) and so \([x]\) is nonempty.  Clearly \(X = \bigcup_{x \in X} [x]\).  Now let \(x, y \in X\). We need to show that either \([x] = [y]\) or \([x] \cap [y] = \emptyset\).  Suppose that the intersection of \([x]\) and \([y]\) is not empty and that \(z \in [x] \cap [y]\). Then \(z \sim x\) and \(z \sim y\).  By symmetry and transitivity \(x \sim y\); hence, \([x] \subset [y]\).  Similarly, \([y] \subset [x]\) and so \([x] = [y]\).  Therefore, any two equivalence classes are either disjoint or exactly the same.</p>
<p id="p-481">Conversely, suppose that \({\mathcal P} = \{X_i\}\) is a partition of a set \(X\).  Let two elements be equivalent if they are in the same partition.  Clearly, the relation is reflexive.  If \(x\) is in the same partition as \(y\), then \(y\) is in the same partition as \(x\), so \(x \sim y\) implies \(y \sim x\).  Finally, if \(x\) is in the same partition as \(y\) and \(y\) is in the same partition as \(z\), then \(x\) must be in the same partition as \(z\), and transitivity holds.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-sets-and-equivalence-relations.html#proof-5">in-context</a></span>
