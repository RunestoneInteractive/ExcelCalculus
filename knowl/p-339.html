<p>Throughout this book, we are limiting ourselves to mathematical tools that the student can reasonably expect to find in a generic work environment.  That is one of the reasons for focusing on using spreadsheets and Excel.  A second reason is that we will spend a significant amount of time on functions defined by data points, where we then try to construct a formula.  However when we are starting with a formula, there are easier ways to produce a graph.  The simplest is to use the free website, Wolfram Alpha.  For example to obtain a graph of the functions \(f(x) = x^2 – 3 x\text{,}\) as \(x\) ranges from \(-5\) to \(5\text{,}\) we simply type “plot x^2 – 3 x for x from -5 to 5” and obtain:</p>
