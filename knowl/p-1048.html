<p><dfn class="terminology">A Note on Terminology</dfn>:  It is worthwhile to point out some ambiguity in the terms used in this section and the previous section.  We have been using the term for \(marginal\ f(x+1)\) the change \(f(x+1)-f(x)\text{,}\) where \(f(x)\text{,}\) might be revenue, or cost, or profit.  This is the standard definition of a marginal function from finance or economics.  However, if you do a web search on “calculus marginal revenue” you will find that most calculus books treat the marginal function as simply another name for the derivative.  While they are related, they are not the same thing.  In the next chapter we will find that it is often easier to produce a formula for the derivative of a function rather than the related marginal function, which is why the derivative is used for the marginal function.  However, in this text, we will stick to the correct definition of marginal functions.</p>
