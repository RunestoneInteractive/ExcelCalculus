<p>All of the functions above have graphs without breaks.  In mathematical terms, they are continuous functions.  When we are modeling real world phenomena, we also want to use functions that have breaks in the graph.  Paint is typically bought in gallon containers, so the price to paint a room is based on the number of gallons rounded up to the next whole number.  Many businesses will give a volume discount to their best customers, so there is one price for small quantities and a different price for large quantities.  The cost of labor changes if overtime pay is involved.  In all of these cases the graph has a break in it.</p>
