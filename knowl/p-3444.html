We have looked at the definite integral as the signed area under a curve.  This lets us compute total profit, or revenue, or cost, from the related marginal functions.  We have looked at a number of applications where this was interpreted as an accumulation over time, including total production of an oil well and present value of a revenue stream.  For some applications we want to look at the area between two curves, for example considering profit as the area between the cost and revenue curves.</p>
