<p>The order of operations used by Excel differs from the traditional order of operations when it comes to taking powers of negative numbers.  The problem is illustrated in evaluating  \(-3^2\text{,}\) which has a negative sign and an exponentiation. In all math classes you have taken this is interpreted as \(-(3^2)\) or \(-9\text{,}\) with exponentiation done first.  In Excel, this is interpreted as \((-3)^2\) or 9, with negation done first.  When in doubt, use parenthesis to make the order of operations explicit.</p>
