<p>The MAA curriculum guide (2004) notes that many of our current math courses were designed in the last century in response to the needs of physics and engineering. One might caricaturize a standard textbook for business calculus, often called brief calculus as a watered down version of a three-semester course in calculus that was designed for physics or math majors. Since it is trying to cover more topics in less time, the main emphasis is skill in symbolic manipulation. The standard text for a one semester survey of calculus is also used for both business and the life sciences. To allow for broad marketing the text is technology agnostic, follows the arrangement of a course for majors, and uses the notational conventions of mathematics.</p>
