<p>We are running a business and want to minimize equipment expenses.  For a particular piece of equipment the costs can be broken into initial outlays to buy the equipment, fixed annual expenses to keep the equipment in the inventory, and repair costs which we anticipate rising as the equipment gets older.  A widget press costs $10,000 to buy, and the operating expenses are $500 a year, and the total repair costs are \(300t^2\) over the first \(t\) years.  What is the optimal length of time to use a widget press before replacing it?</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Solution</dfn>:  My annual cost equation is total cost divided by t.  This annual cost is:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
AnnualCost(t)=10000/t+500+300t.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>I create a spreadsheet that calculates the cost and its derivative over the first 10 years.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/sec3-4-11.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>Looking at the data, the minimal annual cost is obtained by keeping the press between 5.5 and 6.0 years.  Using Goal seek on the derivative, I find the minimal annual cost of $3,964.10 is obtained by keeping the press for 5.77 years.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-4-Optimization.html#example-38">in-context</a></span>
