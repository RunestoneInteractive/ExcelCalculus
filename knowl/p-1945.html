<p>When using the method of related rates, we act as if the derivatives are fractions that we can multiply or divide to obtain the appropriate fraction.  We want to use a bit of caution with that approach, because it does not work with higher order derivatives, or with derivatives of functions of several variables.  However, for derivatives of one variable the intuition works.  Once again, if we zoom in far enough, the curve will look like a straight line and the derivative is the quotient of rise over run.</p>
