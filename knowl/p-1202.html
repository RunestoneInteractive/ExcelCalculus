<p>Recall, we said that the derivative can be thought of as the slope of the apparent line, obtained by zooming in on the graph of a function.  Clearly, we cannot have an extremum at an interior point of the domain if the derivative is nonzero, because we could go either higher or lower by moving a little to the right or left.  Thus we can only have extrema at a critical point, a place when the derivative is zero or undefined, or at an endpoint where we cannot go both left and right.  This gives us a small list of candidate points for the optimum value.</p>
