<p>Quadratics are parabolas and the zeros (if they exist) are at \(x=  \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The vertex is always located at \(x=  \frac{-b}{2a}\text{.}\) So if the vertex is to be at \(x = 5\) we need to make sure \(\frac{-b}{2a}=5\text{.}\) There are many ways to do this (there are infinitely many different parabolas with their vertex located at x = 5). One possible solution would be to let \(b = -10\) and \(a = 1\text{.}\)</p>
