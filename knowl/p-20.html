<p>Use of business examples: The standard textbook example for related rates is that of a person on a ladder that is sliding down a wall. One student commented that he learned to never stand on an unsecured ladder. In contrast our text uses the Cobb-Douglas equation and rate of change of revenue with respect to cost to illustrate related rates, given that both are functions of quantity. Other examples in the text include the standard supply and demand problems, marginal cost, revenue and profit problems, and present and future value of an investment.</p>
