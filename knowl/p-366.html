<p>Coming up with a theoretical reason why we want to use a particular model in a given case forms the content of a large number of your business courses, both courses you have already taken and courses you are yet to take.  The models that come up repeatedly in the theoretical courses are given names and used without redoing the theoretical foundation for the model.  (This is why we introduced the normal distribution and the logistic growth function, neither of which looks like a simple equation.)  In this course, we will be happy with simple heuristic arguments on which model to choose.</p>
