<p>where ppy is the number of periods per year, indicating how often we compound the interest.  From a simple point of view, the future amount is a function of 4 variables, the initial deposit, annual rate, periods per year, and number of years.  To consider this as a function of a single variable, we fixed 3 of the 4 variables as constants for a particular problem.  In this chapter we want to address the more realistic situation where we treat more than one quantity as a variable at a time.  This approach has the added advantage that most real world functions of interest have more than one variable. Before we look at functions of several variables, we want to create a list of tasks we have learned to accomplish with functions of one variable:</p>
