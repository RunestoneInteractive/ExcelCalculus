<p>One area where Excel is different from a graphing calculator is in producing the graph of a function that has been defined by a formula.  It is not difficult, but it is not as straight forward as with a calculator. It is a skill worth developing however.  When we are given a formula as part of a problem, we will want to easily see a graph of the function.</p>
