<p>Teaching the technology in a way that makes it portable: Experience showed, as expected, that the students would have to be taught to use Excel. Since the intent was to have the students see the material as usable outside of class, the text does not use any macros or instructor provided tools. Students are also expected to use “Good Excel Style” and make worksheets readable with sufficient documentation.</p>
