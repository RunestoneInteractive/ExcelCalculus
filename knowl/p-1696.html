<p>As we noted in chapter 1, in this book we are limiting ourselves to mathematical tools that the student can reasonably expect to find in a generic work environment.  That is one of the reasons for focusing on using spreadsheets and Excel.  However, we will also look at using free web tools, particularly as a means of doing symbolic manipulation.  Differentiation is one of those operations that can be done with free tools available on the web.  The student in this course will be expected to routinely do symbolic differentiation by hand.  However, it is good to be able to check your work.  We also want tools that will work reliably with messier problems.</p>
