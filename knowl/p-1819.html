<p>The mathematical first and second derivatives are used in pricing various financial products and options that are also called derivatives.  The first derivative is used to give a value to whether the underlying product has a price that goes up or down.  It looks at the slope of the pricing curve.  The second derivative is used to give a value to the volatility of the underlying product.  It looks at how much the pricing curve bends.  We will return to these uses when we look at integrals.</p>
