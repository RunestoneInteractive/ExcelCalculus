<p>One of the reasons that spreadsheets are so useful for doing mathematics in a business setting is that businesses often do a relatively simple computation for a large number of cases.  That means we should pay attention to formulas with cell references and the process of copying a formula from one case to another.  In the example above, all of the values change from one month to the next.  It is not hard to imagine a calculation where some values remain the same for many cases.  Thus we want to look at the idea of absolute and relative cell references.  This is a very important topic and an Excel feature we will be using for the rest of the term.</p>
