<p>Consider a demand function and why it is probably not linear.  We expect demand to go up whenever we drop the price.  However with a linear function, we get the same increase in demand by cutting the price in half, or if from half price we give the product away for free.  A more reasonable model may be a power function where decreasing the price by a fixed percentage increases consumption by a fixed percentage.  Similarly when we think about the supply function, we often expect the limits on available materials to make increasing the supply progressively more expensive.</p>
