<p>At the end of the last section we warned that the symbolic integration techniques we have developed only work for problems that exactly fit our formulas.  When we tried integrating an exponential function where the exponent was a constant times t, we had to change the base to get a function with only t in the exponent.  We want to develop one more technique of integration, that of change of variables or substitution, to handle integrals that are pretty close to our stated rules. This technique is often called u-substitution and is related to the chain rule for differentiation.</p>
