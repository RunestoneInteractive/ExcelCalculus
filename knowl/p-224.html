<p>This book will rely heavily upon the use of Excel, since it is the standard mathematical tool used in the business world.  (More precisely, the spreadsheet is the standard tool, and Excel is currently the de facto standard brand.  Most of this text can easily be used with other spreadsheets.) However, we do not assume that the student has worked with Excel previously. Throughout the course we will introduce those features of Excel we need to do mathematics and model the business problems we encounter.</p>
