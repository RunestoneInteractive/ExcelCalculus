<p id="p-3376">  The techniques used in this section can easily be adapted to other distributions.  For example, the mean time to failure of a brand of hard drives, measured in units of 10,000 hours, has been found to follow a Weibull distribution with shape variable 3 and scale variable 5.  The probability density function of failure is </p>\begin{equation*}FailureDensity(x)=(3/5) (x/5)^2 \exp(-(x/5)^3 ).\end{equation*}<ol id="ol-199" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-868"><p id="p-3377">   Our warranty is for 10,000 hours of use.  (This is approximately 1 year.)  What percentage of drives get replaced under warrantee?</p></li>
<li id="li-869"><p id="p-3378">   We offer an extended warrantee that replaces the hard drive if it fails in under 30,000 hours of use.  What percentage of users who buy the extended warranty will have their hard drive fail in the period of time between the expiration of the original warrantee and the end of the extended warranty?</p></li>
<li id="li-870"><p id="p-3379">   Some credit cards double the manufacturerâ€™s warranty.  What percentage of the people who use this plan will have their hard drive replaced by the credit card company?</p></li>
<li id="li-871"><p id="p-3380">   What percentage of customers see their hard drives last for 100,000 hours of use?</p></li>
