<p>When we look at the numbers we see that the total cost of producing 998 widgets is $26,986 and the cost of producing 1009 widgets is $28,063.  When we look at the unit costs, we expect the cost per unit to generally go down as we produce more, since the fixed costs are distributed over more units.  However the per unit cost is $27.04 when we produce 998 widgets, but that goes up to $28.81 when we make 1009 widgets, since we had to buy another block of raw material.</p>
