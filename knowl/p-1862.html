<p>We have two approaches if we want to find the slope of the line tangent to the circle at \((4,3)\text{.}\)  We could first use algebra to express \(y\) as a function of \(x\text{,}\) and then use our rules to find the derivative.  That approach works in this problem but will fail with more complicated relations.  The alternative method is to say that \(y\) is implicitly a function of \(x\text{.}\)  We can then use the chain rule to take the derivative of the relation with the derivative of \(y\) being designated as \(y'\text{.}\)  We can then solve for \(y'\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\text{.}\)  This second method is called implicit differentiation.</p>
