<p>Goal Seek uses Newton's Method, a technique based on Calculus, to find solutions.  The heart of the method is based on the fact that, at least for most functions nice enough to show up in a course like this, when you zoom in far enough on a graph you will get something that looks like a straight line.  The line we find that way is called the tangent line.  (Finding the slope of the tangent line, or the instantaneous rate of change, is one of the main goals of calculus, and is given the name of finding the derivative.)  If we start with a guessed solution, we can produce a tangent line, find the point where the tangent line reaches the desired value, and take the point's x-coordinate as our next guess.  Repeating this process usually converges to a solution. <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/sec1-6-11.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div></p>
