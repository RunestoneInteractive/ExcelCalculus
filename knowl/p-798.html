<p>It is clear from the graph that the market should reach equilibrium at a quantity of 2, but it is not clear what the equilibrium price should be.  We need to do some reasoning about the behavior described by the equations.  From our formula, the supply price for 2 widgets is $2.  However if we look at the supply prices of 2+h for small values of h, we see that the limit of the supply price from above is $4.  In practical terms the suppliers will produce 2 widgets for any price from $2 to $4.  If we offer $2, they are also willing to produce 2 widgets.  If we offer a price of $3.95, they are still only willing to produce 2 widgets.  The suppliers will be thus willing to produce 2 widgets at a price of $3.  The equilibrium price is 3.</p>
