<p><dfn class="terminology">Solution C</dfn>: This method of finding the derivative still has a number of difficulties.  In the example above, the exact answer we want (in this case 2) did not show up in any of our computations.  We also find that if we make \(del\ x\) too small, we run into a problem called round off error.  If the next chapter we will look at methods that compute derivatives symbolically, but for this chapter we want an easy method of approximation.  We will use the approximation technique that is used by most graphing calculators when they compute the derivative.  They use a “balanced difference quotient” where we find the slope of the secant line between points \(del\ x\) before and after the point we are interested in. As the picture below shows, compared to either the right secant or the left secant, for most functions the balanced secant is closer to being parallel to the tangent line.</p>
