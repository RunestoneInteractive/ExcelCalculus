<p>However we do not yet have a rule for taking the derivative of a function as simple as \(f(x)=x+2\text{.}\)  Rather than producing rules for each kind of function, we wish to discover how to differentiate functions obtained by arithmetic on functions we already know how to differentiate.  This would let us differentiate functions like \(f(x)=5 x^3+3x^2+1\text{,}\) or \(g(x)=(x+2) 1.03^x\text{,}\) or \(F(x)= \ln(x)/(x+3)\text{,}\) which are built up from our elementary functions.  We want rules for multiplying a known function by a constant, for adding or subtracting two known functions, and for multiplying or dividing two known functions.</p>
