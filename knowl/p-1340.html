<p>We would also like to find the minimum at the other end of the interval.  To do that it is useful to know a bit of the mathematics behind what solver is doing.  Solver uses derivatives from the starting point to decide on the direction it should look and how far it should go to find the next guess for its answer.  This is a modification of a technique called Newtonâ€™s method.  In terms of our picture, depending on whether we tell it to find a maximum, minimum, or specified value, Solver tries to slide up or down the graph until it finds a good candidate, which it gives us as a solution.  It is actually looking for the first local maximum or minimum it gets to.  It does not look for other candidates.  So if we started at x=0.5 it will slide to the left to find an answer.  To find the minimum at the other end of the interval we need a starting point where the graph is already sloping down to the right. Starting at x=8 should work.  We set up solver.</p>
