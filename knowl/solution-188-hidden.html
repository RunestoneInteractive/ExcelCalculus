<p>Hint:</p>
<p>Elastic (\(E \gt 1\)) The book mentions an elastic market points to something that can be easily substituted and where revenue goes up when prices go down. Examples are a particular cut of meet and for instance a brand of clothes. If there is a sale we would choose the cheaper item. What else falls into this category?</p>
<p>Inelastic (\(E \lt 1\)) This is something where an increase in price would not decrease revenue. One situation would be items that are not easily substituted. For example wedding rings or life saving medication. What else falls into this category?</p>
