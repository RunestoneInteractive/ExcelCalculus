<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Your company is interested in acquiring a revenue stream that is currently producing are a rate of 50+5 t  thousand dollars per year, where t is measured in years.  To obtain current value, you are discounting at a rate of 6%/year compounded continuously.  What is the current value of the first 10 years of income from the stream?</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Solution</dfn>: To find the total income we would want to integrate \((50+5t)\) as \(t\) goes from 0 to 10.  To find the current value we must discount the income based in when we receive it.  Thus we want to integrate \((50+5t) e^{-0.06t}\) as \(t\) goes from 0 to 10.  We set up the integral \(\int_0^{10} (50+5t) e^{-0.06t}  dt\text{.}\)  Since we do not know how to find the anti-derivative for this function, we find the area either with Excel and Riemann sums, or with Wolfram Alpha.</p>

<p>With either method, we find that the present value of the revenue stream to be $545,298.</p>
