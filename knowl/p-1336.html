<p>However, the reason we introduce Solver, is that it can do things would be more difficult with Goal Seek.  From the graph, and our knowledge or parabolas, we know the graph has a single maximum.  To find the maximum with Goal Seek, we need to realize that the maximum occurs when the derivative is 0, define the numerical derivative, then set the derivative equal to 0.  With Solver, we simply ask it to find the maximum.  It finds the vertex at \(x=4.5\text{.}\)</p>
