<p>In Section 3.2 we noticed that the high and low points of the graph of a function often coincided with a point where the derivative of the function was 0.  In a business setting, we are often concerned with finding the maximum and minimum values of a function, because one or the other will be a best, or optimum value.  We typically want to maximize functions like profit, utility, revenue, and market share.  We typically want to minimize functions like cost and liability.  We will use the same basic process to optimize, whether the extremum we are finding is a maximum and minimum.</p>
