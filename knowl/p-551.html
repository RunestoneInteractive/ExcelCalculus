<p>The normal laws of supply and demand assume we are in a market with many producers and consumers, operating independently, all of them looking out for their own best interests.  We expect that when the price goes up, more producers are willing to sell but fewer consumers are willing to buy.  Conversely, when the price goes down, fewer producers are willing to sell but more consumers are willing to buy.</p>
