<p>If we are given a data set, we can find a best fitting curve.  A straightforward approach is to assume that the data represents the output of a nice formula. In real life applications we will often see that so-called noise can complicate the situation.  (For example, if I am looking at sales at a fast food restaurant, our model will have noise from traffic jams and bad weather outside.) For the purpose of this course we will assume that the data will be reasonably nice, although some noise may be evident. The problem of producing a best fitting curve to data can be broken into two pieces:</p>
