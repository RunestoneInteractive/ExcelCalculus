<p>We previously noted that a linear demand price function has a negative slope. We should note the two limiting cases. If the slope of the demand curve is 0, the consumers have a fixed price they will pay for however much of the product is available.  In this case the demand curve is a constant, so the revenue curve will be linear.  This is referred to as a perfectly elastic market.  The other limiting case is where the demand is for a fixed amount no matter what the price.  In this case the demand curve is a vertical line and is not a function, so the revenue curve also fails to be a function of quantity.</p>
