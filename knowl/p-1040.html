<p>Several of our observations from this example work in general.  Looking at a single point, the derivative of a function is the slope of the line tangent to the graph at that point.  The tangent line is a best linear approximation to the graph at a point.  Looking at the derivative at lots of points, the graph of a function is increasing when the derivative is positive, and the graph of a function is decreasing when the derivative is negative.  For the graph to have a point that is locally a maximum or minimum, the derivative cannot be positive or negative, so the derivative must either be zero or undefined for the graph of the function to have a maximum or minimum.  Finding places where functions reach their highest and lowest values is an important activity in mathematics.  We will look at these applications in more depth in upcoming sections.  The reader is warned that we can have places where the derivative is zero but the function is still increasing or decreasing.</p>
