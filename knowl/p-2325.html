<p>With functions of one variable we were interested in places where the derivative is zero, since they made candidate points for the maximum or minimum of a function.  If the derivative is not zero, we have a direction that is downhill and moving a little in that direction gives a lower value of the function.  Similarly, with functions of two variables we can only find a minimum or maximum for a function if both partial derivatives are 0 at the same time.  Such points are called critical points.</p>
