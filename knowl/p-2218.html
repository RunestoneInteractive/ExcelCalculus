<p>The procedure we used in the first example of replacing one variable with a constant and then taking the derivative of the resulting single variable function is a bit cumbersome.  We can simplify the process by taking the derivative of the original function with respect to one variable while treating the other variables as constants.  This is referred to as taking a partial derivative.  There is also a change in notation.  The familiar derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) uses the symbol \(\frac{d}{dx} f\)  while the partial derivative with respect to \(x\) uses the symbol \(\frac{\partial }{\partial x} f\text{,}\) or \(f_x\text{.}\)  Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \(y\) uses the symbol\(\frac{\partial }{\partial y} f\text{,}\) or \(f_y\text{.}\)</p>
