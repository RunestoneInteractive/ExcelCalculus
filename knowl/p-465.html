<p>In previous sections we looked at deciding on a model to use for numerical data, and finding the best fitting curve of that model for our data.  Once we have completed those phases of the process, we have reduced our data to an equation.  At that point we want to use the equation to answer some question.  Sometimes that question will reduce to solving an equation, as when we have an equation for profit as a function of sales and we want to know when the business will break even.  At other times we want to know what input gives a desired output.  (E.g., How much do I need to sell to make $100,000 in commission?)</p>
