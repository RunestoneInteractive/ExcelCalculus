<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Compare the graph of \(f(x)=x^2-2 x+1\) and the graph of its derivative, using separate axes for the two graphs.  What features of the graph of \(f(x)\) can be located by using the graph of \(f'(x)\text{?}\)</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Solution</dfn>: Since this problem will serve as a template for a question we will look at many times, it is worthwhile to look at it in detail.  We start by setting up a workbook that will have the structure we need to compute a chart of values for \(f(x)\) and \(f'(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/sec3-2-7.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>The picture above gives the minimal amount we need to type in.  The rest will be done with quick filling.  The entry of cell B1 gives the formula for the function.  In cell D5 we evaluate the function using the first value of x from cell A5.  We have two values of x in cells A5 and A6 so that we can quick fill to get a list of x values.  We use absolute references for \(del\ x\text{,}\) so it will not change on quick fills.  We then fill cells E5 and F5 from cell D5, then fill row 6 from row 5, then fill the rest of the chart from rows 5 and 6.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/sec3-2-8.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>It is then a straightforward task to plot the two curves.  We notice that the graph of the function is a parabola.  If the derivative is negative, the graph of \(f(x)\) is decreasing.  If the derivative is positive, the graph of the function \(f(x)\) is increasing.  The graph of \(f(x)\) reaches its minimum at the vertex, which is also where \(f'(x)=0\text{.}\)  We also notice that the derivative of this parabola seems to be a straight line.</p></article></body>
