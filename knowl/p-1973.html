<p>The related rates technique is an application of the chain rule.  We use this technique when we have either three variables.  We may want the rate of change of one variable with respect to a second and those variables may be connected through equations using a third variable.  We may also want to relate the rate of change of two variables with respect to time.  We take advantage of the fact that we can think of a derivative as a fraction of two small values.  We either want to multiply or divide theses fractions to obtain the desired derivative.</p>
