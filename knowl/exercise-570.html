<p id="p-3374">  I have been informed that the distance from the back of a chair to the front of the knee of a man sitting is normally distributed with a mean of 24 inches and a standard deviation of 1.3 inches.  I want to design airline chairs to fit 99% of the male passengers with 1 inch between the knee and the back of the next chair.  How much distance do I need between the front of on chair seat and the back of the next?
