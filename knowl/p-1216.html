<p>Throughout the section we have looked for places where the derivative is zero when looking for extrema.  We have not paid any attention to how we decide if the point we find is a local maximum or a local minimum.  There are several approaches we could use.  Since we are computing the derivative we could note that a local maximum is a place where the function goes from increasing to decreasing, so the derivative goes from positive to negative.  (Similarly, a local minimum is at a place where the derivative goes from positive to negative.)  There is also a test that looks at the derivative of the derivative.  Those tests will be more useful in the next chapter when we are finding a formula for the derivative by symbolic means.  However, with the numeric technique we are using, the easiest test is that a local maximum is greater than or equal to points a little bit to both the left and right.  We simply plug in points a little bit to each side to test.  Since a change in q of 0.001 makes the graph look like a flat straight line, we change q by 0.01.</p>
