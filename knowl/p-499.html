<p>A variant of these problems occasionally shows up.  If we start with a carefully rigged problem we can set the algorithm of Goal Seek into a loop.  If we start with the function \(f(x) = x^3 â€“ 50*x\) with an initial guess of x=1, and ask Goal Seek to find when f(x) = 500,  Goal Seek will not find an answer.  In this case we could look at a graph and make an initial guess of 6, and then get a correct answer.  Once again, with a numerical method, it pays to try some cases and make sure that our guess is close to a reasonable answer.  If f(x) is a continuous function, this means finding a value of x where f(x) is too low and another value where f(x) is too high.</p>
