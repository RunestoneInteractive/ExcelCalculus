<p>We should note that the calculator rule is an approximation technique, rather than a definition.  It will give a misleading answer for functions that do not approximate a straight line in a window that is 0.002 wide.  In this course, the approximation will only cause a problem with functions that have corners or cusps, like the functions \(f(x)=|x|\) and \(f(x)=x^{(2/3)}\) at \(x=0\text{.}\)  The main advantage of the using the calculator rule is that it is straightforward enough to compute to allow us to plot a function and its derivative on a single graph.  This allows us to compare the graph of the function with the graph of the derivative.</p>
