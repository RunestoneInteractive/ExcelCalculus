<p>It is worthwhile to point out a detail that may cause a bit of confusion.  Note that we are defining marginal functions of x+1 rather than the marginal functions of x.  This is the standard convention in finance where the question is phrased in terms of change associated with producing one more.  I am more concerned about deciding about what I should do rather than looking at what I have already done. The usual functions with related marginal functions are Cost, Revenue, and Profit.</p>
