<p>This book got its start at a talk by Felkel and Richardson  at ICTCM in 2000 where they claimed "Business students should be taught math using spreadsheets."  A number of years later I tried teaching with their book and found much to appreciate from their approach.  Their book, Networked Business Mathematics, is the initial inspiration of this book.  However, as often happens when an academic looks at a textbook, I found the authors had made some choices I disagreed with, so I wanted to write my own text.  As I was going through beta versions of this book, I  discovered the 2004 report of the Curriculum Reform Across the First Two Years (CRAFTY) sub-committee of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), and the MAA's 2004 curriculum guide.  That report has guided many decision concerning this text.</p>
