<body><article class="example example-like"><p>The raw material needed to build widgets is sold in blocks that will make 100 widgets.  A block costs $1000.  The labor cost for building a widget is $7.  The fixed costs for widget production is $10,000.  Find a formula for the costs of producing widgets.  Find the cost of producing 998 and 1009 widgets.  You should also find the cost per unit at those quantities.</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Solution</dfn>:  To make the worksheet easier to follow, we break costs into three pieces, fixed costs labor costs, and materials costs.  The fixed coasts are constant, and the labor costs are linear.  For the materials costs we need to use the CEILING function to round the number of widgets up to the next even 100, then divide by 100 to obtain the number of blocks of raw material we want to buy.</p>

<p>When we look at the numbers we see that the total cost of producing 998 widgets is $26,986 and the cost of producing 1009 widgets is $28,063.  When we look at the unit costs, we expect the cost per unit to generally go down as we produce more, since the fixed costs are distributed over more units.  However the per unit cost is $27.04 when we produce 998 widgets, but that goes up to $28.81 when we make 1009 widgets, since we had to buy another block of raw material.</p>
