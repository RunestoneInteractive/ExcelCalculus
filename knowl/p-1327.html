<p>We should expect, whenever we look at an operation that is used a lot in the business world, that Excel will have a fairly simple command to achieve the result.  In section 1.5 we introduced Goal Seek, a tool that is part of Excel, and that can be used to solve an equation for a root from a given starting point.  In the last section, we noted that one can find candidates for a local maximum or minimum of a function by finding the derivative and using Goal Seek to find where the derivative is 0.  In this section we introduce Solver, an Add-In to Excel.  It is easiest to think of solver as a more powerful version of Goal Seek.  It will be easiest to walk through the use of Solver while working an example.</p>
