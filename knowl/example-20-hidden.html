<body><article class="example-like"><p>In the widget market the supply is constrained.  Obtaining more than 2 widgets means using a more expensive process.  My supply and demand curves are:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
demand\ price(q)=4-q/2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
supply\ price(q)=\begin{cases}
1q/2+1&amp;q\le 2\\
1q/2+3&amp;q&gt;2\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Find the market equilibrium price.</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Solution</dfn>:  We would like to find the place where the two curves cross.  However when we look at a graph of the two functions we see that they never meet.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/sec2-3-9.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>It is clear from the graph that the market should reach equilibrium at a quantity of 2, but it is not clear what the equilibrium price should be.  We need to do some reasoning about the behavior described by the equations.  From our formula, the supply price for 2 widgets is $2.  However if we look at the supply prices of 2+h for small values of h, we see that the limit of the supply price from above is $4.  In practical terms the suppliers will produce 2 widgets for any price from $2 to $4.  If we offer $2, they are also willing to produce 2 widgets.  If we offer a price of $3.95, they are still only willing to produce 2 widgets.  The suppliers will be thus willing to produce 2 widgets at a price of $3.  The equilibrium price is 3.</p>
<p>If we want to look at the graph in Excel, it is useful to plot points very close to the discontinuity on both sides.  For this problem, we might look at both 2 and 2.0001.</p>
