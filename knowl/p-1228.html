<p>There are three technical details worth mentioning from the last example.  First, in Excel, the best way to put \(\pi\) in a formula is with the constant PI(). Second, the function for area is defined on an open interval where the radius is positive.  There is no maximum area for a can of fixed volume.  (However inefficient our can is, we can always make it worse, by moving farther from the optimum.)  Third, one should also note that for this problem, we wanted several numbers as part of our answer.  The worksheet for the problem puts the best height and radius at the top, where the reader can easily find it.</p>
