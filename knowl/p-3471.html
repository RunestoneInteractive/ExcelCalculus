<p>The sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus is referred to as the <em class="terminology">total social gain</em>.   As we looked at consumers' surplus, we assumed that the sales were determined by supply and the price-quantity point was on the supply curve.  Similarly, when looking at producers' surplus we assume price is set by demand and the price-quantity point was on the demand curve.  If both sides are made up of many individuals acting independently, the price-quantity point is the equilibrium point, which is on both curves.  Selling at that point also maximizes the total social gain.</p>
