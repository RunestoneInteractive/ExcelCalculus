<p>In this section we have focused on functions of 2 variables since their graphs are surfaces in 3 dimensions, which is a familiar concept.  For real world functions, we are often concerned with functions of many variables.  The concept of partial derivative easily extends, with one variable and multiple parameters.  Finding the linear approximation also extends without difficulty.  We simply have a linear term for each variable.</p>
