<p>When finding the best fitting curve to data we have gathered, we need to pay attention to the model we have chosen and to the range to which we want to apply it.  In our example, the linear fit looks pretty good.  However we should be careful about using it on too wide a domain.  According to our model, a worker who works no hours produces 12.52 widgets a week, which is obviously silly.  In the other direction it predicts that a worker who worked 168 (= 7 x 24) hours a week would produce almost 970 widgets, instead of predicting a collapse from exhaustion.</p>
