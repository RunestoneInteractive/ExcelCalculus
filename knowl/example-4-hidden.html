<p><dfn class="terminology">Solution</dfn>:</p>
<p>a) For this example we will use “designer variables”. The output will be Pay, and the input variable – the number of hours worked – will be hrs. We are told that Pay = 500 when hrs = 40. The slope of the line work beyond 40 hours is \(m=18\text{.}\)  Another way to think of this is to say that there is a fixed Pay of $500 and a variable Pay for any hours in excess of 40: i.e. (hrs - 40). Thus, the equation of the line, according to the point-slope form is <article class="assemblage-like"><div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
Pay=variable\  pay+Fixed\  pay.
\end{equation*}
</div></article></p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
Pay=m(hrs-40)+500=18*(hrs-40)+500.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>b) The pay for working 56 hours is 18(56-40)+500=$788.</p>
<p>c) The pay for working 30 hours is $500.  This is a trick question part of the problem.  From the text of the problem, the linear model only works for overtime, with a flat rate applying to less than 40 hours per week. Comment: The function should be written as a piecewise defined function.</p>
<p>This question is all about the function \(f\) defined by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
Pay=\begin{cases}
500&amp;hrs\le 40\\
18*(hrs-40)+500&amp;hrs&gt;40\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
