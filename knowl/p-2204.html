<p>A standard technique in mathematics courses is to try to break a complicated problem into smaller and easier problems.  For functions of several variables this can be done by looking at the variables one at a time, and treating the other variables as constants.  Then we are back to considering functions of a single variable.  We start by returning to Example 5 from the previous section, and seeing what information can be obtained by looking at one variable at a time.</p>
