<p>The disadvantages of the Solver method are the standard disadvantages of using Solver to find a minimum.  Recall that Solver simply finds a local minimum from a starting point.  Since solver uses numerical methods it looks for places where the partial derivatives are within our tolerance bounds of zero.  We cannot expect Solver to give an answer that is more precise than the tolerance bounds. With all of the methods we should be aware that we need enough points to get a reasonable fit of the curve.  Intuitively a small change in any point should not cause a big change in the curve.</p>
